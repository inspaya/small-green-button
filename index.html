<h1>Small Green Button (An outdoor classroom)</h1>

<p>The outdoor classroom is intended to be a set of distributed but remotely interconnected (Outdoor LCD display + RaspberryPi or other computing) units located in public spaces e.g. public parks.</p>

<p>Some Use-cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In situations like Covid-19, where social-distancing is required, schools without an established online learning setup can have their teachers and students interact with each other via this system and with other systems at other locations in real-time.</li>
  <li>For non-formal educational environments, where students are typically semi-literate, adult, working-class persons, this system can be used to tailor the learning experience to best suit their needs.</li>
  <li>For mass education of the public as needed by government agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposed Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An interactive classroom, which involves:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>teacher/student(s) teleconferencing</li>
      <li>educational media/content/assessment(s) displayed on the outdoor lcd and a mechanism for students to engage with the content.</li>
      <li>simultaneous, multi-location, student participation in one or more instructor-led sessions</li>
      <li>options to either centrally manage learning content or create remote stations idependently operated without access to the Internet.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
